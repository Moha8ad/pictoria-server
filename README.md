## Descriptions

Create, Share and Discover Memorable Posts

This repository is a social media application built using React, Redux, JavaScript, Axios, Express, Bcrypt, Moment.js, React-Google-Login, and Material-UI. Users can create posts with images, quotes, and authors, as well as delete them and perform other actions. 

The frontend is developed with React, Redux handles state management, and Material-UI provides pre-designed components for an attractive user interface. Express handles backend operations, with Axios as the HTTP client for seamless frontend-backend communication.

Secure password hashing is implemented with Bcrypt, while Moment.js enhances the user experience with timestamps. Users can sign in using their Google accounts via React-Google-Login, ensuring a convenient login process.

This repository offers a foundation for a feature-rich social media app, enabling users to create, delete, and manage posts with images, quotes, and authors. It prioritizes secure authentication and a visually appealing user interface.
